Please see [Assignment 2](https://github.com/wuga214/OSU_DocAnalysis_Fall2015_Assign2/blob/master/IE_Assignment_Description.pdf) for full instructions on the lab and assignment and what specifically should be completed and submitted.  However, in brief, the lab and assignment tasks are as follows:

1. You will train a conditional random field (CRF) based named entity recognizer (NER) using CRF++ and CoNLL NER data, experiment with various features and model configurations, and comparatively evaluate results on test data.

2. You will build a function to extract key text content from articles on a news webpage and transform it into the format for CRF++ labeling.  You will invoke CRF++ labeling on the extracted text using your trained model and list all NERS found, one per line.
